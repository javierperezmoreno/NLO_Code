% This will be the input from the user
% The user proposes a potential V(x) and the code figures out Beta for that potential 
% We need to find the value of the potential at each interpolation point
% pot(i) is the value of the potential function at the interpolation point i
% In this test, we are trying the potential function V(x) = exp(-x).

% constructing the trigonal matrix
% Creates an trigonal matrix that represents d^2(Phi)/d(a)^2 a

% solving for eigenvalues and eigenfuctions:
% As trigonal matrix is constructed, it is possible to use eig() function, which results in 
% eigenmat - diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and wavevector - a  matrix  whose columns are 
% the corresponding right eigenvectors. Then, function diag() is used to get the diagonal 
% elements from the eigenmat digonal matrix.
[wavevector,eigenmat]=eig(finmat);
eigenvalues=diag(eigenmat);

% Storing the first 100 eigenvalues since only the initial wavefunctions have a strong effect
firsteigenvalues=eigenvalues(1:100);

% Each eigenvalue has a corresponding wavevector that stores the values of a wavefunction at a
% particular interpolation point. Since there are 100 eigenvalues, first 100 wavefunctions are
% taken from the whole vector. 
wavefunctions=wavevector(:,1:100);

% Following nested for loop checks for orthonormality by taking a dot product of all wavevectors 
% in a matrix. Dot product will be zero for different wavevectors and will be 1 if i=j. If wavevectors
% are orhocheck(i,j) will result in a diagonal matrix with values 1 on diagonal and 0 everywhere else.

    end;
end;

% This nested loop with 3 for statements calculates transition dipole moments by taking on each interpolation point
% at a time. For each point a wavevector is multiplied by another wavevector and by x-coordinate of the interpolation point.
% This process is repeated for all 100 wavevectors.

% Normalizing Eigenfunctions
% For eigenfunctions to be normalized, need to divide eigenvectors by the
% sqrt(step size) to nondimensionalize them
